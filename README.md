RNPackages is an application that contains many, many packages from the community. The purpose of this app is to show how a particular module is added to an app, to test `react-native link` commands, and to make sure packages are kept up-to-date.

It also serves as a catalog for all react-native pacakges in the community.

## Packages

* [react-native-video](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-video)
